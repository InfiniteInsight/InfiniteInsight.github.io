# Nevermorelab.com

I wanted a place to talk about my test lab since I am really proud of it. 

I thought about creating a static page in AWS S3 but decided to take the free option with GitHub Pages 

This is my first experience with Ruby and Jekyll and I had a good time figuring out all of the things I could do with it.
