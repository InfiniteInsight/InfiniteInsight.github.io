## Virtualization Hosts
* * *
I have three Simplivity Omnicube nodes (Dell R730xd's) which I have elected not to use in a hyperconverged fashion. 
These give me a large playground in which I can run practically anything.

[Click here to see photos of the server rack!](./server-rack.html)

* 218.4 GHz of compute
* 35 TB of Storage 
* 2.2 TB of RAM
* Gigabit and Ten Gigabit ethernet
* iDRAC remote management


Host1 is running vmWare's ESXi

Host2 is running Microsoft Server and HyperV

Host3 is going to be either KVM or Proxmox
